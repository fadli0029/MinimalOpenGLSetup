### Using GLAD
This setup uses Glad to include OpenGL functionalities: https://glad.dav1d.de/

Extract the zip file and paste the `glad` folder and `KHR` folder into the `include` directory. Put the `glad.c` file into the `src` directory. That's it! The CMakeLists.txt file is already set up to work with this setup.
